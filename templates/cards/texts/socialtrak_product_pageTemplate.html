Approaching this project we really wanted to rethink the common university webpage. 
Loads of student/faculty/staff information, news, admissions data, and events 
were all being displayed at once, cluttering the screen and contributing to a 
confusing user experience. 
<br /><br />
We decided to cut the info in to blocks, displayed the info only to those
who will find it relevant. Site was converted to a responsive, intuitive 
design that students can access from smart phones, tables and PC.
